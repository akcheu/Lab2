                <h3><li>Diary</li></h3>
                <p> Today was a <em>tiring</em> day. While I only had <b>two</b> classes (one in the morning and one in the afternoon), I had to attend many meetings for my research lab. As the only undergraduate in my research project, I am starting to feel imposter syndrome since everyone seems to know what they are doing and are extremely qualified. While the domain is incredibly interesting to me, I am starting to wonder whether research is for me and if I should pursue grdaduate school. I also feel extremely overhwelmed right now with work and wrote a Haiku poem to express my feelings:</p>
                <p>
                    <i>I have too much work</i><br>
                    <i>When will I have time to rest</i><br>
                    <i>I can't wait for break</i><br>
                </p>
                <h3><li>Task List</li></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSE 110 Professor Greeting on Slack (<strong>Due Friday</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Try to fix bug for research project</li>
                    <li>Catch up on yesterday's lecture for 140L</li>

                <p> Wow, what a day! Just like yesterday, I had to attend a lot of meetings for my research labs and did not have much time to rest in between. Today, I finished a few homework assignments which definitely made me feel a lot more productive. I also went to the Biomedical Library to study from 3:00 - 6:00 PM in the afternoon. Then, I met up with my friend for dinner at Sixth College. Overall, it was a pretty nice and productive day :)</p>
